        <li>Plan together</li>
        <li>Deliver services and programs together</li>
        <li>Share resources where appropriate</li>
        <li>Share information that is mutually beneficial</li>
      </ul>
        <p>Getting Ahead participants may receive training through Omaha Bridges Out of Poverty. OR through the organization they currently work with.<br/>OR both!</p>

      <h1>SERVICES AVAILABLE TO OUR PARTNERS</h1>
    
    <p>Our partner charitable service organizations face the challenges that every business faces today and in many cases do not have the dollars available for high level business consulting services.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      However, there is a tremendous resource in our retired professionals in the community and other willing volunteers. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      We have created a catalogue of professionals that are available with a variety of organization skills, business skills, etc. and these individuals are available to consult with our partners on a volunteer basis (you may need to provide coffee).</p>
    
    <div>
      <h4>AN ADDED VALUE.</h4>
      
      <p class="desc">These volunteer consultants are being trained in Bridges Out of Poverty concepts so that they better understand the people you serve.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        
      <h4>ONE MORE BENEFIT.</h4>
      
      <p class="desc">These volunteer consultants meet on a regular basis to share ideans, solutions and resources which provides additional value to our partners.
