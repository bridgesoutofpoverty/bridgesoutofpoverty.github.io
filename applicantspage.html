            <p>For people living in poverty, things are not hopeless. We believe that people are problem solvers. When given a safe, agenda-free learning environment where they can reflect on and examine their own lives, positive things happen. That’s what Getting Ahead is all about. </p>
 
            <p>When you join Getting Ahead sessions, you explore the impact poverty has on individuals, families and communities. Then you use class information, and your own experiences, to create personal goals to implement positive change. </p>
 
            <p>Imagine it like this: 12-15 people sitting around a kitchen table talking freely, openly and without fear of judgement. One of them is a facilitator; the others are investigators (the participants). You are not directed, pressured or dictated to change. You are simply guided by the facilitator to explore, examine, process new information and come up with solutions. You also get paid a stipend because of the value you bring to the table that helps make Getting Ahead successful for everyone involved </p>
 
            <p>70% of people completing “Getting Ahead” earn more money and all have new skills, goals and more hope!
