        <p class="sectionText">In late 2015, Roger Howard a new retiree from a 41 year CPA / HealthcareConsulting career was considering his next 10 to 20 years.  He prayed forguidance and poverty articles and resources started to come his attention.  Eachweek some new person would be introduced to him that helped him move furtheralong this path.  He visited many of the organizations serving under-resourcedfamilies.  He learned there were 100,000 people living in poverty in themetropolitan Omaha area, and that the poverty rate had essentially remained thesame the last 50 years, even with spending more than $18 trillion nationally overthat period of time on poverty programs.  Roger decided there needed to be acomprehensive solution to poverty in our community.  He was introduced to theBridges Out of Poverty Community Model that is being used by 15 million people.After careful review, the Bridges Community Model seemed to be the mosteffective national model and something we needed in Omaha.</p>
        <p class="sectionText">In June, 2016, John Parsons (founder and former Executive Director of theOmaha Street School) who had a similar vision for helping under-resourcedindividuals and families realize their dreams, joined Roger.Together, Roger and John began developing plans and strategies to essentiallydefeat poverty in Omaha in the next 10 years.The first Getting Ahead Class will start in early 2017.</p>
