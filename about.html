        <p class="sectionText">In late 2015, Roger Howard a new retiree from a 41 year CPA / Healthcare Consulting career was considering his next 10 to 20 years.  He prayed for guidance and poverty articles and resources started to come his attention.  Each week some new person would be introduced to him that helped him move further along this path.  He visited many of the organizations serving under-resourced families.  He learned there were 100,000 people living in poverty in the metropolitan Omaha area, and that the poverty rate had essentially remained the same the last 50 years, even with spending more than $18 trillion nationally over that period of time on poverty programs.  Roger decided there needed to be a comprehensive solution to poverty in our community.  He was introduced to the Bridges Out of Poverty Community Model that is being used by 15 million people.  After careful review, the Bridges Community Model seemed to be the most effective national model and something we needed in Omaha.</p>
        <p class="sectionText">In June, 2016, John Parsons (founder and former Executive Director of The Omaha Street School) who had a similar vision for helping under-resourced individuals and families realize their dreams, joined Roger. Together, Roger and John began developing plans and strategies to essentially defeat poverty in Omaha in the next 10 years.The first Getting Ahead Class will start in early 2017.</p>
