        <p class="sectionText">In late 2015, Roger Howard, a new retiree from a 41 year CPA     / Healthcare Consulting career, was considering his next 10 to 20 years.  Mr.       Howard began studying the issues surrounding poverty and discovered a variety       of programs and trillions of dollars of government funding have been               ineffective in reducing poverty.  Based on his consulting career, he               approached the problem from the top down, assessing what it would take for         Omaha to essentially defeat poverty.
        </p>
        <p class="sectionText">    
            In June 2016, John Parsons, founder and former Executive Director of the Omaha Street School, had a similar and long-standing vision for helping under-resourced individuals and families realize their dreams.  Mr. Parsons and Mr. Howard joined forces during the summer of 2016, intending to eradicate poverty in our city.
        </p>
        <p class="sectionText">    
            Research indicated that there are approximately 100,000 people living in poverty in the metropolitan Omaha area.  And despite government expenditures of more than $18 trillion on the <q>War on Poverty</q> since 1964, the national poverty rate had essentially remained the same.  For Omaha, it is time for a comprehensive poverty solution.
        </p>
        <p class="sectionText">    
            Mr. Howard and Mr. Parsons, with the input of community partners, have developed a plan to help 50,000 under-resourced individuals lift themselves out of poverty by the year 2026.
